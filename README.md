# SVGTint
Sample of loading svg files with customized color tint/mask
After creation of vector image in Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator we can use it in Android projects throught the AndroidSVG library (http://gradleplease.appspot.com/#androidsvg)
This is appliable for both monochrome and color images, including semitransparent images.
To apply color tint - just add ColorFilter to image.
No screen-dependent image sets or additional resources needed. Resizing of picture can be performed programmatically just by setting Canvas size.
